CONTEST STRAT
	do subtasks quickly
	tangible progress every 15 mins
	read all problems 1st
	try quick cheesing
	dont give up
	100M/1e8 ops per sec (calc complexity)

DUMB OPTIMIZATION
	ll only when needed
	char s[] > string s
	use bitset/arrays/light ds whenever possible
	use scanf/printf
	use '\n'
	iterative > recursive
	define ds as global
	array access in nested loops is slow so use temps
